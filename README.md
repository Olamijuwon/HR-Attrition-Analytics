## Result/Findings

1 - Attrition: Number of people who leaves a company.

(It can be said that their low salaries are one for them to look for a higher paying Job)

9 - Entry level has higher attrition with a wide range followed by Junior and middle level. Executive and senior with the lowest attrition rates. (Reason can be the same as that of monthly income)
